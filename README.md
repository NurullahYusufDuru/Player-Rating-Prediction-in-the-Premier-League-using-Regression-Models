# Premier League Player Performance Regression

This project analyzes Premier League player data and applies regression techniques to model and predict player performance metrics. The objective is to explore the relationship between player attributes and performance outcomes using a data-driven approach.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of Premier League player statistics, including physical attributes, match-related metrics, and performance indicators.  
Key preprocessing steps include:
- Data cleaning and feature selection  
- Handling missing and inconsistent values  
- Exploratory analysis of numerical relationships  

## Methodology
The analysis follows these steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations  
2. Feature selection for regression modeling  
3. Train–test split  
4. Regression model training  
5. Model evaluation and interpretation  

## Models Used
- Linear Regression  
- Regularized regression models (e.g., Ridge / Lasso, if applicable)

The models are compared to assess how well linear relationships explain player performance.

## Evaluation
Regression performance is evaluated using:
- R² score  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Residual analysis  

## Technologies
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn  

## Conclusion
The results provide insights into which player attributes are most strongly associated with performance in the Premier League. The project demonstrates how regression analysis can be used as an interpretable baseline for sports analytics tasks.
